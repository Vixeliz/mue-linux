Packages that need updates but have problems atm:
icu (causes problems with webkit2gtk for the time being will fix soon)

Some pkgs that currently cant be built offline:
any git packages
any go packages

Ideas for package manager:
git caching then checksums against latest master,
or for depends for example mesa || mesa-intel for building chooses first one by default but will accept second one
