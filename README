___________________________________________________________________________________

Mue Linux is an attempt at a minimalistic linux system with strong ideals.
You can find more information about the ideals here https://muevoid.org/ideals

Huge thanks to dylanaraps for kiss linux which muelinux is based off of. See https://k1ss.org
Also another thanks to carbslinux for inspiration and some build files! See carbslinux.org

Why games? These are mostly games from the kiss-games repo however I have chosen ones that I
particularly enjoy and work without xorg libs.

Here is an overview:
- No rust
- No bash
- Try to make things portable and allow for people to submit patches for certain architectures other then x86_64
- Wayland only, No xorg libraries(only a few needed but most aren't really "Xorg" libs anymore)
- Everything must be able to be built without an internet connection(working on this)
- Emphasis at hacking your system and creating utilities(Thinking of ideas to promote this)
- Not losing security at the cost of simplicity
(why some choices are made such as libtasn1 for webkit2gtkor seatd wlroots)
- Sta.li filesystem (I am looking into static linking vs dynamic linking)
- Everything compiled from source no binary packages in official or community repos

Note all of these if you don't agree with nothing stops you from packaging them for yourself.
These just apply to the official repo and community repo(if there ever is one).

Stuff I'd like to do:
- An install helper script to make install's a little faster for repetive task.
(As of right now I am planning on doing a ncurses c program)
- A live cd
(will most likely fork eudaldgr's kiss-live repo for mue-linux)
- Rewrite the kiss pkg manager in c with some features i'd like addded as well
(working on figuring out exactly what would be needed to do this)

Reasons for certain packages:
Most of these packages are mainly due to them being needed by me;
however, I am going to split up the repo more at some point soon.

My goal is to have a flexible repo where it has a minimal base for people to build upon.
Currently everything is in extra however I would like to split it up.
